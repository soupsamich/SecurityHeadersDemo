# Overview
This educational platform demonstrates how security headers protect websites from common attacks through interactive simulations. Users can experience real attack scenarios and see how each security header provides protection.

# Installation:
1. Clone the repository into your virtual host  
```git clone https://github.com/soupsamich/SecurityHeadersDemo.git```

2. Install dependencies  
findInputs depends on the `flask` python module.  
```pip3 install flask```

3. Run the application  
```python3 securityheaders.py```

4. Visit through your browser  
The website should be running on your local host on port 5000  
```https://localhost:5000```


# Usage
üéì How to Use
- **Start with the Home tab** to understand what security headers are
- **Work through each header tab** in any order you prefer
- **Try the interactive simulations** - see what you've learned in action
- **Enable/disable protection** to see the difference
- **Take the quiz** to test your knowledge
- **Retake sections** as needed to reinforce learning

üîç Educational Approach  
This project uses:  
- **Real-world analogies** (security guards, bouncers, return addresses)
- **Practical scenarios** (banking, healthcare, e-commerce)
- **Visual demonstrations** with color-coded results
- **Good for all skill levels** from basic concepts to technical details

# Disclaimer
üö® Please note! This is an educational tool designed to teach security concepts.  
DO NOT deploy this application to production or any public-facing environment. This code contains intentional security vulnerabilites and lacks proper security controls required for production use. This is meant to be a learning exercise only.

üè† Local Development Only
- Run ONLY on localhost (127.0.0.1 or localhost)
- Never expose to the internet or network accessible environments
- Do not deploy to cloud platforms, shared servers, or hosting services
- Use only for learning security concepts in a controlled environment

üéì Educational Context  
The security vulnerabilities demonstrated in this application are intentionally simplified for educational purposes. Real-world security implementations require:  
- Proper input validation and output encoding
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security audits and updates
- Following OWASP guidelines and security frameworks

üìö Learning Responsibility  
Users are responsible for:  
- Understanding that this is educational demonstration code
- Not using this code as a template for production applications
- Seeking proper security training for real-world development
- Following secure coding practices in actual projects
